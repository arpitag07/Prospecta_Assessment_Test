Use the "csv" module in Python to read the input CSV file, allowing for easy parsing of the data into rows and cells.

Iterate through each row and cell of the input CSV data. If the cell starts with the '=' sign, it indicates that it is a formula.

If the cell is a formula, use eval() function or a library like pandas to calculate the result.

If the cell is not a formula, add the original cell value to the output row.

Use the csv module to write the output row to the output CSV file.

Repeat the process for all the rows in the input CSV file.

Close both the input and output CSV files.
